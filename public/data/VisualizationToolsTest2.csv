LaNet-vi,Visualization,http://lanet-vi.fi.uba.ar/,"Academic Free License , Creative Commons Licence",LaNet-vi is an open-source network visualization software. It is an acronym that stands for Large Networks visualization Tool.LaNet-vi is based on the k-core decomposition of a network. This decomposition was introduced by Seidman in 1983 and divides the network in layers (the cores) thus providing a centrality measure for nodes. One of its main applications is the study of the Internet topology.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaNet-vi,"Linux, Microsoft Windows",C++
